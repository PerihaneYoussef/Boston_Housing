## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

In this project i applied the basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. First I explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I properly splited the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. Analyzed the performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enabled me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

### Data
The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Features

- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
- LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
- Target Variable 4. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes
